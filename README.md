## Abstract
The World Health Organization (WHO) identified the world's most lethal illnesses in a 2019 report. In Indonesia, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes rank as the leading causes of death. Due to the prevalence of these conditions, innovative strategies are necessary to improve early diagnosis and preventative measures. Our team was motivated by the prospect of leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a tool that could assist in the timely identification of these critical health conditions. The "Sano - Disease Condition Predictor" project focuses on using machine learning implementation to predict three major diseases: heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Our project involves the development of a user-friendly application and the integration of robust data analysis tools. Sano helps patients and medical professionals to make educated decisions by providing predictive insights, with the ultimate goal of reducing the prevalence and impact of life-threatening diseases.

## Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) identified the world's most lethal illnesses in a 2019 report. In Indonesia, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes rank as the leading causes of death. Due to the prevalence of these conditions, innovative strategies are necessary to improve early diagnosis and preventative measures. With the technology development nowadays, there are several innovative strategies to enhance early diagnosis and preventive measures, such as disease classification. Efforts to improve disease classification systems can play an important role in improving health service. By leveraging data-driven insights and emerging technologies, such as machine learning, healthcare providers can better predict disease risk, optimize resource allocation, and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health.
## Objectives
Our team chose to explore the intersection of healthcare and machine learning because of the significant potential to positively impact people's lives through early detection and intervention. We specifically focused on heart disease, stroke, and diabetes due to their high prevalence and the opportunity for machine learning algorithms to play a crucial role in early diagnosis. By addressing these conditions, we aim to tackle the challenge of timely identification, which is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Our motivation lies in leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a tool that can enhance healthcare professionals' ability to detect these conditions early, thereby contributing to better health outcomes and quality of life for individuals at risk.
## Team Roles
### Machine Learning
Utilize TensorFlow and a curated dataset containing health indicators to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The project will involve comprehensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, and feature selection. Machine learning algorithms will be implemented and  evaluated using metrics such as accuracy with help of confusion matrix.
### Mobile Development
### Cloud Computing
Deploying the backend and ML model on Cloud Run, with the database hosted on Cloud SQL. The backend uses Express.js to provide REST API endpoints auth and manage user authentication and data. The ML model for health predictions is implemented in Flask and integrated into the system for seamless communication between ml model and backend.
