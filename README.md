## Abstract
The World Health Organization (WHO) identified the world's most lethal illnesses in a 2019 report. In Indonesia, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes rank as the leading causes of death. Due to the prevalence of these conditions, innovative strategies are necessary to improve early diagnosis and preventative measures. Our team was motivated by the prospect of leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a tool that could assist in the timely identification of these critical health conditions. The "Sano - Disease Condition Predictor" project focuses on using machine learning implementation to predict three major diseases: heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Our project involves the development of a user-friendly application and the integration of robust data analysis tools. Sano helps patients and medical professionals to make educated decisions by providing predictive insights, with the ultimate goal of reducing the prevalence and impact of life-threatening diseases.

## Team Roles

### Machine Learning
Utilize TensorFlow and a curated dataset containing health indicators to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The project will involve comprehensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, and feature selection. Machine learning algorithms will be implemented and  evaluated using metrics such as accuracy with help of confusion matrix.

### Mobile Development
We created a machine learning-based early detection system. This system is equipped with a mobile application that functions as a user interface.  To make it easier for users, this application has an intuitive and user-friendly display, especially when entering health data.  Health data that can be entered through the application includes medical test results and current symptoms.This mobile application was built using Android Studio with the Kotlin programming language.

### Cloud Computing
Deploying the backend and ML model on Cloud Run, with the database hosted on Cloud SQL. The backend uses Express.js to provide REST API endpoints auth and manage user authentication and data. The ML model for health predictions is implemented in Flask and integrated into the system for seamless communication between ml model and backend.
